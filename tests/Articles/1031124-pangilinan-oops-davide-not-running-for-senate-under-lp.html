Former Chief Justice Hilario Davide is "not inclined" to run for senator in 2019, Senator Francis "Kiko" Pangilinan said Wednesday.

Earlier, the Liberal Party president named Davide as among the opposition's possible bets in next year's senatorial elections.

The former chief magistrate however informed the senator that he was not inclined to seek a Senate seat.

"I met with him (Davide) yesterday, he is not inclined to run," Pangilinan said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel.

"But sabi ko sa kanya habang may buhay, may pagasa. Malayo pa ang deadline baka magbago ang kanyang isip," he said.

Meanwhile, Pangilinan said they were still in talks with another former Chief Justice, Maria Lourdes Sereno, who was also drafted in the opposition's slate.

In fact, he said, he was set to meet with Sereno later Wednesday.

Asked about former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, Pangilinan said the former had no decision yet.

"Mar has not decided. In fact, I'm seeing him, I asked for time to see him to find out what his plans really are. He has not decided," he said.

Aside from Davide, Sereno, and Roxas, the senator earlier released a list of possible senatorial bets of the opposition.

On Pangilinan's list were Sen. Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, former-Quezon Rep. Erin Ta√±ada, lawyer Chel Diokno, former-Solicitor General Florin Hilbay, former Akbayan Rep. Ibarra Gutierrez, former-presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda, singer-actress Agot Isidro, actor Dingdong Dantes, Manolo Quezon III, singer Leah Navarro, singer Jim Paredes, election lawyer Romulo Macalintal and former Social Welfare Secretary Corazon "Dinky" Soliman. /cbb
