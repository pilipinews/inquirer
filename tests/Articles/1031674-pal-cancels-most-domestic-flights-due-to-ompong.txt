"Ompong" entered the country Wednesday afternoon and is packing maximum sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour (kph) and with gustiness of up to 255 kph.

It is moving westward with a speed of 30 kph, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said in its Thursday morning severe weather bulletin.

As of 4 a.m., the state weather bureau said that Ompong was last spotted at 780 kilometers East Northeast of Guiuan, Eastern Samar.

The Manila International Airport Authority earlier canceled flights in Batanes.
