SAN PEDRO CITY - The police on Thursday will file murder charges against Trece Martires City Mayor Melandres de Sagun and three others in relation to the killing of vice mayor Alexander Lubigan and his driver, Romulo Guillemer.

The Cavite police will file two counts of murder and one count of frustrated homicide.

A source, who requested anonymity pending a press conference in Camp Crame, said the charges would be filed at the Department of Justice.

Lubigan was killed in a gun attack on July 7. His driver, Romulo Guillemer, also died of bullet wounds. Another aide survived the attack.

Lubigan was believed to have plans to run in the 2019 elections for mayor against de Sagun's wife.

De Sagun's camp claimed the mayor was out of the country when the crime was committed. MARICAR CINCO
