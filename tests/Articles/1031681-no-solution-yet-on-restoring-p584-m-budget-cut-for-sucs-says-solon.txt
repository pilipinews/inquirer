NO SOLUTION YET ON RESTORING P584-M BUDGET CUT FOR SUCS, SAYS SOLON

Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles said there is no solution yet on how to restore the proposed P584 million budget cut for State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in 2019.

Nograles revealed this as a resolution was earlied filed urging the House Committee on Appropriations, which he chairs, to restore the funds for the maintenance and other operating services of SUCs.

"I have no solution yet in sight. I'd want to obviously find a source to be able to restore it in SUCs," he said on Thursday's Meet Inquirer Multimedia forum.

According to Nograles, restoring the funds meant slashing some funds for other government projects.

"Restoration entails that I have to find it somewhere... If you give me a supplemental budget, then we can restore [it]," he said, also citing proposed budget cuts for other government agencies including the Department of Health and the whole Department of Education.

He said, however, that he has nothing in mind yet where to get the funds should Congress decide to restore the budget for the SUCs.

But he assured that the lawmakers will "cross the bridge when they get there." /je
