The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Thursday filed before the Department of Justice (DOJ) a complaint for murder and frustrated murder against Trece Martires Mayor Melandres Desagun for the death of Vice Mayor Alexander Lubigan.

Also named in the complaint are Maragondon Cavite Councilor Lawrence Arca, Luis Vasquez Abad Jr., Ariel Fletchetro Paiton, Rhonel Bersamina, and several John and Jane Does.
