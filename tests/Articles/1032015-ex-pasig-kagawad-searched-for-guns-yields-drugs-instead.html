EX-PASIG KAGAWAD SEARCHED FOR GUNS, YIELDS DRUGS INSTEAD

A former barangay councilor (kagawad) in Pasig City who surrendered to authorities under "Oplan Tokhang" in January was caught keeping a stash of suspected "shabu" (crystal meth) inside his house on Thursday.

A report from Chief Supt. Bernabe Balba, Eastern Police District (EPD) director, said Randy Remudo was arrested at his residence on Dela Paz Street in Barangay Caniogan, Pasig, where he relocated after serving as kagawad of Barangay Bagong Ilog.

The police actually came for the 43-year-old Remudo to serve a search warrant, issued by Pasig City Judge Danilo Cruz, on suspicion that he was keeping unlicensed firearms.

Instead, they found two sachets of shabu "in plain view" upon entering the suspect's house, according to Balba.

The drugs weighed about 11 grams and had an estimated street value of P22,000.

According to the EPD, Remudo has been on the Pasig police drug watch list since 2017 and surrendered under the "Oplan Tokhang" antidrug campaign in January this year.

Police records also showed that Remudo survived an ambush staged by motorbike-riding gunmen in December 2016. -JODEE A. AGONCILLO
