SC: NO WORK SUSPENSION IN NCR EXCEPT FOR COURTS AT MANILA CITY HALL

The Supreme Court (SC) has announced on Friday, Sept. 14, that there is no work suspension for courts in the National Capital Region except for courts located at the Manila City Hall.

SC Spokesperson Atty. Gleo Guerra said Chief Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro has instructed executive judges, because of their personal knowledge of the circumstances of their respective localities, to order work suspension at their sound discretion.

Guerra said the decision not to suspend work in Metro Manila is because of the 4 a.m. special weather forecast by Pagasa (Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration) that the greater Metro Manila area will only experience light to occasionally moderate rains and thunderstorms. /muf
