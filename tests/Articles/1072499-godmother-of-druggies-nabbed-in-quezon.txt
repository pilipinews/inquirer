LUCENA CITY, Philippines - Police arrested the so-called "godmother" of drug users in Quezon province in a buy-bust operation in Tayabas City on Saturday, police said Sunday.

Khadija Fabre, 48, who drug users fondly call "ninang," was arrested with another drug pusher Japeth Vi√±as, 23, in an anti-drug sting in Sumilang Subdivision in Barangay Mateuna at about 5 p.m., Senior Supt. Osmundo de Guzman, Quezon police director, said in a report.

Authorities seized 12 plastic sachets of shabu weighing 1.7 grams with an estimated Dangerous Drugs Board value of P21,645. The drugs are worth P52,650 on the street at P4,500 per gram.

The illegal trade of the suspects was tipped off to policemen by former clients who surrendered to authorities. /cbb
